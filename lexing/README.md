parse a c-like grammar and display tree if correct

## Getting Started

1. Clone project
4. Start with `lex-template.py`
5. Complete the rest!

## Hints

If you get stuck, checkout `myparser.py` where I gave it my first attempt!

**disclaimer**: It's not entirely correct, so don't just copy it.

## Thanks

Dr. Thyago Mota for providing:
- template: `lex-template.py`
- test files: `src/`
